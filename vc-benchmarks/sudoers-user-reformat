# Sample sudoers rules to allow a non-root user to reformat a test partition,
# without a password
#
# Some of the experiment scripts create so many files that it can take hours to
# delete them all, because the Linux ext file system family does not emphasize
# delete performance. In those cases it's much faster to just reformat the
# partion.
#
# Those experiment scripts will have a command line option to enable the
# reformatting option instead of just deleting the files normally.
#
# To use:
#
# 1. Create a special test partition
# 2. Add a mount point in /etc/fstab
#
# 3. Copy this file into the /etc/sudoers.d/ directory
# 4. Make sure the copy is owned by root and has permission 440
# 5. Adjust the rules in the copy for your user name, uid:gid (if not
#    1000:1000), and device name.
